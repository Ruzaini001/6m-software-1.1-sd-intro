## Assignment

In this assignment, you will learn to use the developer's tool to inspect the elements of [this](https://nznznh.csb.app/) webpage.

1. What is the right margin of the first element? 
```
50px
```

2. What is the top padding of the second element?
```
100px
```

3. What is the class name of the third element and the content of the css?
```
a) elementThree
b) padding: 10px;
   background-color: aquamarine;
   text-shadow: 1px 1px white;
   border: gray solid 2px;
   border-radius: 10px;
```

4. What is the css selector of the fourth element?
```
"div:nth-child(6)" uses the element selector
```

5. What is the code you use to keep the blue box within the purple?
```
The code that ensures that blue box is within purple is:

<div class="parent">
      <div class="child">
        Keep the blue box withiin the purple box using the box-sizing property.
        You can edit the css code on the developer's tool.
      </div>
</div>

The edit to be made to ensure perfect fit is changing the width from 100% to 97%:

      .child {
        border: mediumblue 8px solid;
        width: 97%;
        height: 100%;
        margin: 0;
      }
```

> hint: you should apply box-sizing property to the `.child` class. Make the changes on the developer's tool to see immediate UI change.
